A webpage designed for the creation of public and private movie reviews using Google OAuth

**Link to project:** Work in progress (finding new hosting site after heroku took away free tier)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Google OAuth for authentication

## Optimizations

I would like to create more points to review (acting, visuals, etc) and also better render user profile images. Also plan to add a way for users to upload movie posters.

## Lessons Learned:

Was able to take a deeper dive into Node.js, Express, and MongoDB while getting some first hand experience with Google OAuth. Felt great getting this project uploaded and making it ready for use.
