## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Google OAuth for authentication

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

I would like to create more points to review (acting, visuals, etc) and also better render user profile images. Also plan to add a way for users to upload movie posters.

## Lessons Learned:

Was able to take a deeper dive into Node.js, Express, and MongoDB while getting some first hand experience with Google OAuth. Felt great getting this project uploaded and making it ready for use.
